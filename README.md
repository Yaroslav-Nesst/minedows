## Minedows Workstation has released!

i will not show you what is it, it is modded mineos!

## How to install?

The easiest way is to use default **wget** script. Insert an OpenOS floppy disk to computer, insert an Internet Card, turn computer on and type the following to console to install Minedows:

	wget -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yaroslav-Nesst/minedows/master/Installer/BIOS.lua /tmp/bios.lua && flash -q /tmp/bios.lua && reboot

You can paste it to console using middle mouse button or insert key (by default). After a moment, a nice system installer will be shown. You will be prompted to select your preferred language, boot volume (can be formatted if needed), create a user profile and customize some settings
